# Sample artillery bombardment imagery: eastern Ukraine, 2014

Provided here are data on possible artillery bombardment sites [identified in eastern Ukraine by MapInvestigation and Bellingcat](http://mapinvestigation.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/smoking-grads-evidence-of-90-cross.html), covering the period July-September 2014.

Here we provide two products based on this work:

* `mapvestigation_ukraine_dataset.zip`: the data in ESRI .shp format, for use in geographical information systems like QGIS.
* `\google_satellite_export` : JPEG images of the underlying satellite imagery (mostly from August/September 2014) from Google, drawn from OpenLayers using QGIS and exported using its Print Composer at 300DPI and scales varying from 1:5000 to 1:8000. The number in each filename relates to the ID number of each bombardment site included in the .shp file. The coordinates of the image corners, however, do not precisely relate to the extents of each polygon in the Mapinvestigation data. 

The satellite images have formed the basis of training and testing data for ARCADE.

Google and their data providers retain all rights on this raw imagery. We have retained the ownership information on each image. We are hosting it herein good faith, not for profit, in line with [Google's Permissions pertaining to web maps](https://www.google.com/permissions/geoguidelines.html#maps-web).
